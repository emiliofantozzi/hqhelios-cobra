# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic exists in epic file but not contexted
#   - contexted: Epic tech context created (required before drafting stories)
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - drafted: Story file created in stories folder by *create-story
#   - ready-for-dev: Draft approved and story context created by *story-ready
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation by *dev-story
#   - review: Implementation complete, ready for review by *code-review
#   - done: Story completed by *story-done
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - completed: Retrospective has been done by *retrospective
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epics should be marked `contexted` before stories can be marked beyond `backlog`
# - SM typically drafts next story ONLY after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', SM reviews, then Dev moves to 'done'

      Epic 2 is READY for Phase 4 (Development).

      All prerequisites met:
      - 9 stories created and validated
      - Story 2.9 added per Product Owner decision (FR11)
      - Dependencies mapped and sequenced
      - Risks identified and mitigated
      - Implementation readiness report reviewed

      Dev agent can start with Story 2.1 immediately.

      Execution sequence: 2.1 → 2.3 → 2.5 → 2.6 → (2.2, 2.4, 2.7, 2.9) → 2.8

    next_steps:
      - "Dev agent: Execute Story 2.1 in next session"
      - "Follow strict sequencing to avoid blocking issues"
      - "Mark stories as DONE in sprint-status.yaml as completed"
      - "Run code review after each story"
      - "Execute retrospective when Epic 2 is complete"
